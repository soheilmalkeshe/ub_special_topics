# UB Special Topics Exercises Repository

Welcome to the UB Special Topics repository! This repository is designed for reviewing and submitting exercises related to your special topics lessons.

## How to Submit Your Exercises

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Work on your exercise and make sure to commit your changes.
3. **Submit your exercise as a Pull Request (PR)** to this repository.
4. In the **PR title**, include:
    - Your full name
    - Your student ID
    - The exercise number
      Example: `ali roshan nia - 123456789 - Exercise x`

## Review Process

- Once all exercises are submitted, only **one solution will be merged**â€”the best one from the submissions.
- For the next exercise, **all participants will need to continue working on the code that was merged**, not their own previous submissions.

This will ensure that the repository contains the best possible solutions, and everyone works with the most up-to-date and optimal code for each exercise.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
